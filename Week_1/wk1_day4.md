# HTML

During this portion we will learn HTML

# Semantic ðŸ’ª > DIV

Tonight we will be moving from code pen into creating a html and css docs that are linked. On top of this we will be reading up on semantic html and why it is so useful as a developer. Were going in depth in HTML and CSS since next week were strating JavaScript so we need to be comfortable with these before moving on.
When you're a developer you work in teams and often have touch the same code bases asyour co-workers. It is a critical skill to be able to format your code so that your team can understand and read it quick and easy. All comes down to communication.
Also sematic HTML increase SEO, or the efficiency the search engine can read your website.... better SEO means more users.

Goals:
ONLY USE TERMINAL COMMANDS IN VS CODE TO MOVE AROUND AND CREATE FILES!

- Open your VS Code and navigate to your git repo you made earlier this week. Navigate into yor week_1 folder (using the terminal).
- Create a new branch so you hve a copy of this folder.
- Create a "index.html" file and a "style.css" file within this new bracnch inside the week_1 folder.
- Link these files together so your HTML can "see" your CSS.
- Create a faux newspaper site :newspaper:using semantic HTML.

## MUST INCLUDE AT LEAST:

- List
- nav
- header
- footer
- article section
- Add CSS styling.
  EXTRA: time permitting add some CSS animations and custom fonts .

DUE SUNDAY:

- Finish anything left of your newspaper and create a pull request to merge to your branch.
- Create a codepen showing off a visual based upon your call sign. Go all out and get creative.
- Create an account on Medium.
- Create a post on Medium talking about first week and explaining how to create a branch and use pull requests .
  (The purpose of this is to write like your teaching someone who knows knowing about it. By teaching and explaining it really helps you internalize it. Even if you dont like writing, this will pay dividends!)

Ways to include CSS in your document
External stylesheet : attach a separate document in the <head> of your HTML.

<link href="css/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
Internal stylesheet or embedded stylesheet : Include styles in the <style> tag in the <head> of your HTML

<style>
    body {
        font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    }
</style>
Inline styles : occur in the HTML tag itself


<p style="color: purple;">I am a purple paragraph!</p>
I am a purple paragraph!

Which should you use?
99.999% of the time: External stylesheet

It is rare that you will need inline or embedded/internal styles, but you should know they are possible.

CSS Selectors
We will cover four simple ways to include CSS in your document:

Elements: HTML tags as selectors
Classes
IDs
Descendant selector
Element selectors
Simply list the HTML tag and how you'd like it styled.

body {
    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
Class selectors .classname
Create a class and attach it to an HTML tag to make the class appear.

You may have more than one class per tag.
You may use a class several times in a document.
Classes are more specific than HTML elements and will generally override them.

<style>
.warning {
    color: orange;
    font-weight: bold;
}
</style>
â€‹
<p class="warning">This paragraph displays a warning!</p>
This paragraph displays a warning!

ID selectors #idname
Create an ID and attach it to an HTML tag to make the styling appear.

You may use the ID only once per page.
Each element may have only one ID.
IDs are the most specific, overriding styles from elements and classes.
IDs are not commonly used in CSS these days. They are more commonly used with JavaScript.

<style>
#danger {
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;
    text-transform: uppercase;
}
</style>
â€‹
<p id="danger">This text is uppercase, bold, and red, and you better pay attention because you're in danger only once on this web page!</p>
THIS TEXT IS UPPERCASE, BOLD, AND RED, AND YOU BETTER PAY ATTENTION BECAUSE YOU'RE IN DANGER ONLY ONCE ON THIS WEB PAGE!

Descendant selectors .classname element {}
This is a combination of one or more classes, IDs, or elements, separated by spaces, to indicate a family relationship.


<style>
.warning p {
    color: violet;
}
</style>
â€‹
<article class="warning">
  <p>All paragraphs in this article will have a color of violet.</p>
  <p>This paragraph too! No more classes needed!</p>
</article>
All paragraphs in this article will have a color of violet.

This paragraph too! No more classes needed!

Grouping selectors
Make all h4 AND h5 red:


<style>
h4, h5 { color: green; }
</style>
â€‹
<h4>I'm Green</h4>
<h5>I'm Green Too!</h5>
I'm Green
I'm Green Too!
Make only the h6's in <section> blue:


<style>
section h6 { color: blue; }
</style>
â€‹
<section>
  <h6>I'm blue!!</h6>
</section>
<h6>I'm NOT blue</h6>
I'm blue!!
I'm NOT blue
Make the h4's and h5's inside <section> pink:


<style>
section h4, section h5 { color: pink; }
</style>
â€‹
<section>
  <h4>I'm pink!!</h4>
  <h5>I'm pink too</h5>
</section>
<h4>I'm NOT pink</h4>
I'm pink!!
I'm pink too
I'm NOT pink
For easier reading, you may wish to write selectors on separate lines:

section h4,
section h5 {
    color: pink;
}
Note that this is NOT the same as the above selector. This says "make all h4's in sections have a black background, and make ALL h5's have a black background."

section h4,
h5 {
    background-color: black;
}
Common CSS properties and values

Link Pseudo-classes
Pseudo-classes: specify styling in these states.

:link â€” unvisited link
:visited â€” visited state
:focus â€” the currently "focused" (selected) element
:hover â€” hover your mouse over this
:active â€” the time between the link is selected and the time the page loads. (Not used much today.)
If you are using these pseudo-classes, they MUST go in the order listed.

To remember:

Lord Vader Former Handle Anakin

:link, :visited, :active are used almost exclusively on links (the A tag).

The pseudo-classes :focus and :hover are used with links and with any other element on the page. :focus is especially useful with forms and in accessibility contexts.


<style>
a.example:link {
    color: #c02d28;
}
a.example:visited {
    color: blue;
}
a.example:focus {

Exercises
Waaaa, it "doesn't work"!!!
Remember to use the HTML and CSS validators if things are looking odd in the browser, or if the colors in the editor seem off. That's an indicator that you've made some errors along the way. The HTML validator is great for catching errors pertaining to syntax, tag spelling, tag nesting, and applying the right attributes to a given tag. The CSS validator will find unclosed curly brackets, properties and values that don't exist, and more.

On Your Own
Begin styling the "about" page you made yesterday.

If you still need more to do, make a page about some of your hobbies and activities and style it, or style the hobbies page you made yesterday. Include:

What is this hobby exactly?
How does it make you feel?
Where have you traveled because of your hobby? What other life experiences has your hobby provided, that you might not otherwise experience?
Photos and/or videos of your hobby in action
Links to websites describing your hobby, or where hobbyists discuss what they do
If you manage to get as far as creating both web pages, link them together with a navigation bar.
