# Command Line Cardio üèÉüèΩ

Tonight we will focus on command line, git and getting started using Codepen. The best way of learning the most used commands is to use them over and over.

The common practice since you all have your own branches now is to treat it as your own Master. As devs we never want to modify our working and "good" branch but to make a copy branch, make changes, then submit via a pull request to have another co-worker look it over to make sure its good before combining with the original (the one you made last night.) This is not a race, take your time and with git sometimes the slower you go the faster it is since errors and issues with git can be time consuming. At the same time don't be afraid to make mistakes and ask for help. I included a good video you can watch a few times that will walk you through the process.

tip: You will never memorize everything for devlopement. We need to be able to search for things quickly. Keep the words simple and minimal in Google search. (ie. to find how to create a folder using terminal try "terminal command make folder"). Talk to Google like a kindergardener lol.

Do the following to your branch and push the changes when complete.

1. Create a copy of you local branch. (Make sure your on it and not master when you make the new branch.)
2. Create 14 new folders titled week_1, week_2 etc in git branch USING THE TERMINAL only. Since we cannot push empty folders to github we will create a README.md in each with text sunch as 'Week 1'.
   tip: Using the ‚¨ÜÔ∏è key you can get your previous git commands you used.
3. Do your normal add, commit and push but now you will have to go into github and figure out how to initialize a pull request to merge into your main branch that you created last night.
4. You should now have to do a pull request to merge your branch
5. After you get pull request done Slack out"Pull complete @Arrow".
6. After you get that open codepen and get some html on your screen. Slack out "Codpen @Arrow" .
7. Feel free to help and assist others. The best ways of learning are making mistakes and helping others.
