The terminal allows you to control your machine with the command prompt.
We do this as a form of efficiency in regards to building projects, adding tools to our web apps through various CLI tools, as well as debugging.

## How to Open the Terminal

To open the terminal press command + space bar and it will launch the spotlight. Type in terminal and press enter.


## Commands 
Here are a list of commands that can be used in the terminal:

cd - Change Directory
ls - List 
pwd - Print Working Directory
mv - Move
cp - Copy
mkdir - Make Directory
rmdir - Remove Directory
less - allows you to read a short snippet of file in Terminal
cat - Concatenate files and print on the standard output
echo - Write arguments to the standard output
touch - Update the last-modified date on the given FILE, but we use to to create a file
rm - Remove file

Tonight we will focus on command line, git and getting started using Codepen. The best way of learning the most used commands is to use them over and over.

The common practice since you all have your own branches now is to treat it as your own Master. As devs we never want to modify our working and "good" branch but to make a copy branch, make changes, then submit via a pull request to have another co-worker look it over to make sure its good before combining with the original (the one you made last night.) This is not a race, take your time and with git sometimes the slower you go the faster it is since errors and issues with git can be time consuming. At the same time don't be afraid to make mistakes and ask for help. I included a good video you can watch a few times that will walk you through the process.

tip: You will never memorize everything for developement. We need to be able to search for things quickly. Keep the words simple and minimal in Google search. (ie. to find how to create a folder using terminal try "terminal command make folder"). Talk to Google like a kindergardener.

Do the following to your branch and push the changes when complete.
