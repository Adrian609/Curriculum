# Face to Face session

This is the first class so we will focus on going over the curriculum and what to expect.

## Intros and course overview

Make sure that relevant information is shared.

- Where are you from?
- Branch of service?
- What to you want to get after this class is complete?

## What we expect of you

Make sure to clearly set the expectations of the students.

- Work is not a request but needs to be complete by deadline.
- Just like the military we do not want excuses but how things will be fixed or completed.

## Mentorships

This is a big area for us since we have many mentors that work 40+ hours a week in a job have families etc and still put in time to help and mentor you. Their time MUST be valued and the communication with them has to be there at all times.

- Set clear schedule goals with mentor.
- Meet at least once a week.
- If an emergency does come up and you cannot meet notify either myself or Jerome in a three-way email or Slack message.

## Fun

This will be hard work but remember to have fun. I always say that when things get really hard and your struggling with the same code for hours that is where the learning actually takes place. If everything works perfect the first time you probally got lucky.
