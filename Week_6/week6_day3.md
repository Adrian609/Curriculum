# Flexbox üí™ and Building Your API üèóÔ∏è

Today we will start adding some styling to our site using built-in CSS flex box. This is a fairly new addition to CSS and before flexbox devs would have to use floats and clears to format in rows.

## Read

Only read up to CSS Grid... we will cover CSS Grid later... for now just read from start to end of flex box.

## Goals

1.  If you haven't yet get the form data to the back route.

2.  Inside the route add the data onto the data coming from the data.js file. (You do not have to persist the data... but for a stretch goal you could use the FS library to write to the file... but save this for last if you have time.).
    SUMMARY: So now when a user submit forms and you go to /api/cars the new car will be in the API... but it will not actually be in the cars.js file, hence it doesn't persist.

3.  Use flexbox to add some styling to your index.html and add in a navbar with the following links

    - Home
    - API
