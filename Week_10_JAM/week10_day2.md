# Jamming with Markdown and more Gatsby

We all need to be pushing code to github on a daily basis. Once you have your first job it's ok since most of your code will
be protected but as a newbie you need to have a bunch of green boxes on your github to get past the initial screening.

Since Markdown is a part of the JAM stack we will play with that some today and push some code to one of your repos.

## Goals:

1. Pick one of your repos and make the README nicer looking with markdown.
   Readme's are pretty much your bookcover to your repo. Use it to sell yourself and your project while explaining how the user can use it.
2. Continue on the Gatsby tutorial.
