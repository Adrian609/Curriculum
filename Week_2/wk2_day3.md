# Forms and User Data üìù

Tonight you will see how JS can reach into your HTML and grab onto and change some data. Pretty cool stuff.

### READS:

- [JS where to](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_whereto.asp)

### Goals:

- Add an empty paragraph tag with an id below you form in your HTML

- Make sure your form has at least 2 inputs with 2 lables associated with the inputs.
- Figure out how to add those greyed out placeholder looking things inside the inputs (Used to give the user a feel of what to type). See Slack after this post for image example.
- From the reading above add a script tag to your HTML so that you can write JS in your file.
  NOTE: There are 2 places on the HTML doc you can add the script tag... one is better then the other and the reading above has the answer.
- When our button is clicked we want to display the text "FORM SUBMITTED" in that empty p tag.
  Find how to grab a hold of html using vanilla JS (If you don't include 'vanilla' you may see 5 ways of doing it with some funky $'s everywhere)
- After you add this code to your script look up how to change HTML using vanilla JS.
  TIP: You'll most likely see many examples in your searches. Do not copy and paste. Type it and try to undertand the process. The method names you will be using are fairly intuitive.
  EXTRA: If you get this far now latch onto one or more inputs using JS and console.log() the user input when form is submitted.

## For Thursdays Class:

Scope is a huge part of JavaScript and something that will help you understand and write better code.
Read the following to understand this as it will be needed before understanding "var, let and const".

### READ:

[You Don't Know JS - What is Scope](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch1.md)
...Then
[Var, Let and Const](https://hackernoon.com/js-var-let-or-const-67e51dbb716f)
Read up on the differences between var ,let and const for declaration of variables.
Create a codepen showing the use of both global and local variable and use comments to show understanding.
extra credit: Show how let and var differ in scope based on block scoping and function scoping.
