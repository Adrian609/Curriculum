Tonight we will be reviewing and making sure were comfortable with the following:

- Functions
- Iterators(loops)
- Objects
- Arrays

## READS:

[Dot vs Brackets in Objects and Arrays](https://codeburst.io/javascript-quickie-dot-notation-vs-bracket-notation-333641c0f781)

## Goals:

Starting the night off right with a function:

- Create a function that uses a loop to create an array of numbers from 0-100. Do this first using a "for loop" then make it using a .forEach() method on the Array API.You will be using the forEach() on the array you made in the for loop.
- Using the same files from this week with the form (if you haven't already make a separate js file and link it to the html) make an object in the js file.
- Must have at least 3 key value pairs.
- One of the value must be a function.
- Now use dot notation to reach in a modify one of the values.
  RESOURCE: [Here](https://www.dyn-web.com/tutorials/object-literal/properties.php)
  Next add a key value pair to your object (without modifying the original object syntax.)
  Do as many of the repl.it s as you can in time remaining.
  DUE BY SUNDAY:
  Create a new branch and add folder to week 2 "JS Calculator".
  Add HTML, CSS, and JS files linking them together.
  Create a working JS calculator that is a simulator but does all basic calculations (add, subtract, multiply and divide). All numbers will be clickable will display the values in the input when clicked just like a calculator. Then when (=) is clicked it will show the result.

Mandatory for name name and great challenge for name name: Make a little box in the top right corner showing the weather (Check out DarkSky or Openweather map for the api calls)
