# Do You Even JavaScript Bro?üèãÔ∏è

Tonight we will be practicing some JavaScript we introduced last night. For this we will use codepen. After this we will be doing some HTML in VS Code that will allow us to use some JS to manipulate in tomorrow's class.
By now your probably wondering "cool, but how does console.log() convert to interaction on web apps? This will help show this.

Goals:

## Create a new pen and do the following:

- Create a variable with each of the three types we covered last night using JS commenting to label them.
- Create a function that takes in a string as a parameter and console.log() the uppercase version of that string ( We did not cover this but can use this for reference). Look the the left hand built in methods.
  ie. Takes in "cool" and console.logs "COOL".
  Create another function that takes in one parameter and checks what type it is. From here use an if... else statement to check for types and console.log ("This is type \_\_\_\_") based on the if else checks.

  (Hint: Look up "typeof in javascript")

- Create one Array and one Object of any types, keys etc of your choice.
  Go back into your repo in VS Code and create another html and css doc in week 2. Build an html form that includes a button and if you get done early add some css styling to make the form look good.
