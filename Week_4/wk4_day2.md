## Timers and Intervals

- Create a new branch in your repo and include an index.html and app.js file.
- Create an object and use destructuring to pull out the values and console.log them. (Can we use const with an Object if we are going to mutate it? Why or why not?)
- Make a timer in your JS file that for every 3 seconds it pulls a random name out of an array and displays that name in a h3 tag.
  HINT: Check out "Math" in JS
- After you have that working write and execute the function reverseString that we went through yesterday with out Googling the answer... only using docs.
- Use the code to login to [FrontEnd Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) and check out the classes offered for a minute.
- Work through as many of the REPL.it problems as you can with the time remaining. We want to see a daily progress with these!
