# Constraint Validation API

In regards to user form validation there is server-side and client-side. Client side is all about making the user experience better as far as making it crystal clear what is required for password, username etc.

There is an easy way to do client side such as

```
<input type="email">
```

This will show the user a message saying that a @ is required and other important factors. Although it does allow us to modify the message of the error it does not allow us to use any CSS styling. This is what we will learn bringing together HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
