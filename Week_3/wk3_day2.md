# Navigating with Bootstrap ðŸ‘¢

Tonight we will be building some HTML utilizing Bootstrap which we went through last night. First we will be practicing some JS just to make sure we progress with that while digging into CSS.

### FYI: The blue words in these are all links you can click on and direct you to the resources.

## Goals:

Create a new branch "yourbranch_Bootstrap" (make a new branch from your own branch not the 'master') and add a folder "JavaScript" to the root (same level as the weekly folders ).
Create an index.html inside the folder and link a JS file to practice JS. The HTML doesn't need anything in the body but the script tag so we can run the JS in the console.
We will be using this setup throughout the course to do a constant practice with vanilla JS.
Create one example each showcasing the built-in JS String methods of
.charAt()
.concat()
After the JS create another index.html in your week 3 folder and link up your CDN for Bootstrap V4.
Add in a bootstrap NavBar.
Finally using the grid system (container, row and columns) copy and paste your faux newspaper html from week 1 and levearge the grid auto sizing.

## Due by tomorrow's class:

Integrate some form or jQuery into what you created tonight.
