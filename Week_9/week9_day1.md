# Intro to React JS

## Why use React?

Here lets just get into the high level "Why us React?" and what will it do for us devleopers and also the end users.

- Virtual DOM - Huge performance gain due to rendering only what needs to be re-rendered.
- Huge Backing - FB dev team
- Maintainability - Components are reusable and ealy maintained.
- Brings together the HTML, CSS and JS all in one component.

## React => Vanilla JS

Here we will show how React tranlates directly to HTML and JS.

Add in body:

```
 <div id="root">not rendered</div>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.4.1/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.4.1/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
```

Add in script:

<img src="./images/react_one.png" />

## Show Props and State

<img src="./images/react_two.png" />

## JSX

What is this HTML looking thing called JSX?
Make sure to point out that atteibute className and onClick are different proving that even though it looks like HTML it is not, it just mimicks it.

TIP: Using the analogy of a function and parameters will help in showing a component and props. Just wrapping up some code, making it flexible and using it by passing in any props.
