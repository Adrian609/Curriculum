# Writing some MongoDB

## Goals:

First some vanilla JS

1. In your JS folder you made in your repo add to your js file an example of each :
   - .filter()
   - .includes()
2. Using Robo3T and the command line for mongo make a database named "favorite_foods"
3. Now add a collection named "street foods"
4. Insert at least 3 pieces of data, with the structure below, into this collection and make sure it populates inside of Robo3T.
   {
   name:string value,
   spicy:boolean,
   rank: integer 1-10
   }
   5)Share some screen shots in the "Heroes for Hire" channel when finished.
