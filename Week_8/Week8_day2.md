[Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

## Goals:

1. Install create-react-app globally if you hadn't already

2. Open a empty folder and navigate here in your terminal and create a new React app using create react app

3. Go to the 'src' folder where these component App.js lives

4. Clear out jsx and have it render only one H1 of "Hello React"

5. Post a screen shot in slack

6. Create a component called "title. Js" and have it render 'your name' React countdown.

7. Use props to pass your name into this component making it dynamic and flexible.
