# Putting all of the Pieces Together

## Goal

1. Build your own full stack app like the Tesla car app while integrating MongoDB in for data storage.
   NOTE: Keep this app simple to start with. Just get all the pieces connected and functioning first. Then it's easy to add on functionality and build out a more complex app if you desire. We need to get this done and up so you can add to your portfolio.

BONUS POINTS: Add in a testing library like Mocha or jest to test some of the code.

TIPS:

- Start with your express server after initiatizing your package.json.
- Make routes folder with a htmlRoutes.js and apiRoutes.js
- get your routes files connected to your server and get your home route ('/') to serve up a simple html file.

NOTE: This uses mongoose which is an ORM (object relational mapper) that makes it easy to interface with Mongo and use it's built in methods. Feel free to use or keep out.
