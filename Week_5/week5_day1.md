# Big O and Optimization

## Big O

Watch: [Big O](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw)
Cheatsheet: [Big O CheatSheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)

## Concepts:
- Upper bound and Lower bound 
- Worst Case, Best Case, Average Case
- Signs of big O in code
   - Loops!
   - Big function calls
- We are trying for algorithmic SPEED!
- Faster algorithms means the CPU has time to do more jobs!
- Minimize the effects of a dramatically scaling input

### Goal:

- Show three examples of BigO on a codepen
  - one of 0(1) - can be very simple (think arrays)! 
  - one of O(n)
  - one of O(n^2)

## Critical Thinking Question:

- We are given 25 Horses and 5 Lanes on a racetrack
- How many races would it take to find the fastest 3 horses?
   - Time is not taken (fastest must be calculated by racing)

### Questions:
- Is this the best we can do?
- How can we improve this?

### Goal:
- What is the connection between this and big 0 / computer algorithms?

### Concepts to explore on your own:
- [P = NP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem)
   - The biggest question in modern CS
   - P = NP would mean extremely difficult problems would be algorithmically EASY!
   - The importance of Mathematics
