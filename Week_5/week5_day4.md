# We learned a lot

## Catch up Day
... review and practice!

### Extra Challenge:
# GCD or Prime Factorization

## GCD
- Using the concepts we learned
- Write a function returning the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) between 2 integers

Starting Point: [GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)

1. Use Euclidean's Algorithm
2. Solve `GCD(a,b)`, returning the gcd of `a` and `b`
3. You can research as much as you'd like
4. This is your extra Challenge

Warning: if you just cut and copy code from online, you will not learn much!
- Be cautious in copying code.
- Try to understand the concept, the steps, and the Algorithm
- Then implement (code) it yourself

### For Prime Factorization, you are on your own. Use the guidelines above.
- Note: For LARGE integers, Prime Factorization will take a LONG TIME!!

##### With code and CS, you only through failure and struggle! We have all been there!
