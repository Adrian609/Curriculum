## Unit Testing with Mocha and Chai

We will be testing almost everything from here on out. Testing isn't hard but give you a sense of security when deploying production code.

Do not worry about the set up too much right now... it deals with the NPM install for Node which we will be covering this week. For now we will just run it on CodePen.

## Goal:

- Fork this codepen from [SITEPOINT](https://codepen.io/SitePoint/pen/XXzXLX).
- Make your own test creating a function that takes in two integers and adds them giving the sum of both.
